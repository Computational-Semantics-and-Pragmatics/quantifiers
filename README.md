# Logic of quantification 

This assignment aims to introduce you to the logic of quantifiers, also known as
first-order logic. This is a formal system that allows us to represent (and
reason about) objects and their properties.

## Reading

* Kearns Ch. 3.
* [First-order logic notes](first-order-logic.pdf) (recommendend)

Notes are for a deeper study. If you are new to logic, you may skip this reading
for now.


## Our notation

We will use the following symbols in writing logical formulas:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `A`    | universal quantifier |
| `E`    | existential quantifier |
! `~`    | negation |
| `&`    | conjunction |
| `V`    | disjunction |
| `>`    | conditional |
| `=`    | equality|
